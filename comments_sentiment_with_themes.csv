"Poor guide, you are showing two routes, the btr spawn at the same spot for both the power line passage, but at 1:45 you show a picture of btr spawning at scav bunker, afterwards you say that for the second route it will not stop at emercom, but then you say it only stops at sawmill and usec camp, so it actually dont stop at emercom at all, all of that is more confusing than anything else. lots of things doesnt make sense. Also at some point you are saying that the btr stop at usec camp, and the video show the btr stopping at sawmill.",-0.6000000238418579,Yes

What‚Äôs the route if it‚Äôs spawns at the Scav Bunker?,-0.10000000149011612,Yes
Are you very sure about that information? I had the BTR spawning on me right at Old Sawmill. Might be on minute 35. But it was certainly very very early. In the first 10 Minutes for sure. And it came from the mesh gate in the north-eastern most corner of the map.,0.0,No

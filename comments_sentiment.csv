"Your narration is top tier. Immediately subbed within 10 seconds. I've been keeping an eye out for a Tarkov guide channel with quality narration that isn't annoying in some way or other. Example, listening to Affliktid I keep wanting to shout at him to clear his throat",0.20000000298023224

"it also spawns at the back roads behind old sawmill, the road that leads to the mines. i know this because this is where i camp waiting for it to spawn. i'm surprised no one else knew this. hope this information helps someone. very surprised to know it has other spawn locations",0.10000000149011612
third spawn point: old sawmill,-0.10000000149011612
"Poor guide, you are showing two routes, the btr spawn at the same spot for both the power line passage, but at 1:45 you show a picture of btr spawning at scav bunker, afterwards you say that for the second route it will not stop at emercom, but then you say it only stops at sawmill and usec camp, so it actually dont stop at emercom at all, all of that is more confusing than anything else. lots of things doesnt make sense. Also at some point you are saying that the btr stop at usec camp, and the video show the btr stopping at sawmill.",-0.6000000238418579

Why the F is the BTR shooting me all the damn time.,-0.699999988079071
There are definitely more routes than this. Was waiting at Old Sawmill and at exactly 33:45 it stopped at its designated location,-0.699999988079071
What‚Äôs the route if it‚Äôs spawns at the Scav Bunker?,-0.10000000149011612
Are you very sure about that information? I had the BTR spawning on me right at Old Sawmill. Might be on minute 35. But it was certainly very very early. In the first 10 Minutes for sure. And it came from the mesh gate in the north-eastern most corner of the map.,0.0
"BSG is brain dead.  Thank you for this video.  Dunno why they wanna make accepting / turning in quests the most difficult part.   Tons and tons of tech in the game, but BTR and LK can't use a phone or a radio to give quests?",-0.20000000298023224

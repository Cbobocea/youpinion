love guides, one definitely misses spawn point log book many think spawn. video shows crouching looking seat, log book spawned sandwiched underneath cushion seat closest catwalk could seen reached standing. barely sticking similar spawn location postman pat shoulder.
picked extracted item inventory lol wtf glitch, everything else looted me...
best part guides quick point are. especially watch portion mid-raid, hahaha.
great always ! sorry spamming ya, tasks piling decided factory night 😅
bro idk bsg expects us see without guide like atleats put seat floor helicopter
